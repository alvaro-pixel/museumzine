I want to start uh by actually showing

everyone my favorite of your photographs

oh I don't even know what your favorite

is Susan I'm excited idiot you're not

gonna be surprised taken lots you've

taken pictures of all kinds of

communities and landscapes and portraits

but this is my favorite Oh your dog for

those of you who know Cathy's work she

does a lot of portrait photography and

uh our puppy Phoebe was in her studio

one day and Kathy hopped her up on the

stool and managed to uh tap into

Phoebe's calm and contemplative side

which is only last was last usually two

seconds and feeback world

that's hilarious Susan yeah so I wanted

to start with that but what we're really

here to do today is to talk about your

current work yes which is presently on

view at Reagan projects in LA this show

opened in the weeks prior to the

pandemic shut down open for two or three

weeks no one week

oh one week yeah one week you know it's

it's okay this has happened to every

single artist every institution in the

world and you know even though we work

for a number of years making a body of

work and getting it up to the point of

exhibition I actually feel fortunate

that I was able to see it in in its one

week

versus having other artists who've

worked on exhibitions for years and that

those exhibitions are literally canceled

so the one week was good I got to see

what it physically looked like that came

out of my head and I think that's

something that an artist is always

anticipating is what happens when the

work gets into the actual space yeah now

um we brought a group the directors

Advisory Council and Friends to LA in

February during fries week we got to

visit you in the studio

as you were you had just finished most

of this work and we're getting ready for

it to go over to the gallery to be shown

so I feel like our group was in on this

from the beginning so it's a good

opportunity then for those who were with

us to see it installed in the gallery um

the name of the show is rhetorical

landscapes do you mind just saying

something about the title Kathy well

yeah I think that if you really think

about my bodies of work you understand

that there's always a relationship to

language or building upon language in

what the kind of visual culture and

visual world begins to do in terms of

informing us both true you know a

practice of image making that's about

bearing witness but also a practice of

image making that is you know building

world so to speak for us to look at as a

rhetorical landscape is is really about

language and relationship to this

current administration this show

wouldn't have been built if it wasn't

for the current political climate of

America right now it's in direct

response for that some people might know

a body of work i did where i went to

washington d.c to photograph

inauguration obama's inauguration and

there's always been

very big sign of me as a person who has

dealt deep into the history of American

politics in representation so rhetorical

landscape is the landscapes of swamps

right that we should drain the swamps

this this rhetoric we're here take dr.

day but in my mind you know being a wife

of somebody from Louisiana swamps are

actually very beautiful delicate

ecosystems so I wanted to mirror the

landscape of swamps with doing

stop-motion collages is what the viewer

is seeing on the monitors and begin to

kind of use the idea of how we build

language through a visual culture within

this so will you just break down for us

just quickly what the show is comprised

of this sir photographs yeah there are

photographs that I made predominantly in

Florida and Georgia of swamps I was

teaching at the ACA which is the

Atlantic center of Arts and to not last

February but the prior February February

2019 and I went there to teach and you

know when you often when you go

someplace you're thinking like well okay

I'm going to be there what am I going to

do and then after making the modernist

which was the exhibition prior to this

exhibition I knew that I wanted to go

back into the landscape but I wanted to

go back into the landscape in in what

swamps are and looking at them and so

the exhibition is designed in such a way

that you are with a very traditional

sized landscape photograph which is like

about 30 by 40 inches and framed in you

know this kind of beautiful walnut frame

so using like the kind of tradition of

contemporary photography in an

exhibition of these landscapes that

in in the years that I've been talking

about landscape in different ways I

talked about it as a pause as a moment

where we kind of gather ourselves and

you'll you sink deep into these

landscapes in different ways these swamp

views where you see alls and alligators

then there's a certain quietness about

them and I'm always curious about what

the landscape or the idea of going out

into nature provides us as human beings

in relationship to the cacophony of

information that we're taking in on our

daily lives and so this exhibition tries

to actually grapple with those questions

so I want people to be able to see so

these are the these are some of the

photographs of the swamps but I have an

animation as well a monitor to show and

so these monitors - were in the gallery

yeah you're in a circle they're in a

circle facing outward and I picked the

monitors because they look like

oversized iPhones so when you're

physically near the monitor you're it's

taller than you unless you're a very

tall person but it's taller than me

which is really important and you know

through the years of teaching at UCLA

I'm and talking to my students a lot

about like Instagram and photography on

this device and that all of us carry a

camera in our pocket right now and what

does it mean the fact that we carry a

camera in our pocket and then I wanted

them in in the body of work the

modernist the protagonist the character

Stosh Fela who's the artist makes a

really large collage oh as as their

artwork as they're burning down the most

iconic modernist houses of LA and so

following that tradition of collage I

was thinking a lot about the history of

political collages and I decided that I

wanted to live on a monitor and to bring

back and

source of mind and probably yours to a

certain extent Susan is Monty Python's

Flying Circus in the 70s I grew up with

watching Monty Python before Saturday

Night Live and those Terry Gilliam

collages really also invoked a sense of

satirical satire within our political

world and so mirroring something about

what we're doing now so what you've just

seen let me describe a little bit about

what you're seeing each image is cut out

from a major magazine from like NRA gun

enthusiasts magazines to you know

regular popular magazines and then home

magazines every kind of image you can

imagine culminating into these so I cut

them out and then I actually

hand-painted large pieces of archival

paper

with a grid and so when you see all of

the monitors each grid is differently

painted and I wanted the hand to come

into it so what's the idea of the hand

and the artist in relationship to this

digital world that we are in

and so the collage that you just saw has

its themes around global warming so each

clause in itself has a very specific

theme that has been constantly referred

to or in the news in relationship to the

current administration

so you're seeing something get built and

animated and then at the end that

monitor holds on to that collage for 30

seconds before it loops again on itself

and so each one is dealing with a very

specific issue in the end they're

tongue-in-cheek there's humor in them

there really interesting to see of

course in relationship to the lush color

photographs of the swamps as well so in

one of the reviews that I read um there

was uh it said it wondered whether you

were think

about print media which of course all of

the monitor images are cut from and

swamps are you thinking about them as

both is disappearing ecosystems

absolutely yeah that's a huge part of it

but the swamps will disappear we will no

longer get magazines in the mail at some

point that we can cut images out of and

so both of these it's trying to and with

using the kind of contemporary wall

monitor because these monitors are

basically used for malls and information

kiosks and so using that as a way of

display brings in that question of how

quickly things do change culturally in

terms of ideas around images and

representation you know I know you to be

aa a news junkie yeah I also know you to

be kind of a nature junkie yeah that's

true as well as well as a gadget junkie

I have all junkie aspects to this to be

a point of intersection for those three

interests with me think the overlapping

issues between the forget the gadgetry

but the news and the landscape and ways

we can continue to talk about tying them

together that's a really interesting

question Susan I think it's something

that I've been grappling with over the

years and different bodies of work I

think when I was doing horizon lines it

was about waiting and kind of what that

provided to us in terms of a form and

what you did to take those horizon line

photographs because it's it's actually

an incredible project well they're shot

with an 8/10 camera so it's a large

format camera and you know it's

basically like when I did the ice houses

I'm out during blizzards with an

eight-by-ten camera on the ice you know

watching the blizzard get worse

wondering not if I was going to get out

of there I did get stuck that's a good

story

it was a Fargo moment for me in

Minnesota but I think that I think that

there was a moment where things changed

with photography as well and I'm and I

think that's the gadget tree right is

photography I've always had what I

called say to my students like have a

big toolbox know what equipment does

because each thing that you use has a

different way that it interprets how you

read an image and so the horizon lines

yeah you're lining up the middle of the

8 by 10 you know glass grid which is

anybody who's gone through a view camera

you might not know but when you look

through it everything is upside-down and

flipped and so you're in the blizzard

doing that for hours trying to make

these very pristine photographs of ice

houses and it's the same thing with in

the swamps you're waiting and you're

looking and I mean a lot of times people

think that I'm all alone but in these

particular photographs especially in the

Okefenokee Swamp I was jumping on a tour

boat and in making sure that I was in

the front of the boat so that I wouldn't

see the wake of water or people's heads

and so even though they feel like very

isolated moments and that's the great

thing about photography it can trick you

by placing you in a place that you feel

very alone especially within the

landscape and I like that I think that

that's an interesting way to think about

how we have to slow down our lives like

can the landscape be another place of

meditation I think for me who doesn't

have a practice in meditation often the

act of going out and photographing

becomes that that kind of place for me

um I think that that makes sense

looking at your photograph

you know it seems to me uh that you have

used photography to get to know a thing

yeah and you know you've used that in

all different ways in different

communities I think of like the football

players and portraits of the surfers and

ice houses are a great example and now

the swamps um so would you mind sharing

what you learned from taking these

photographs like what do you know now

from having these encounters well

knowing what not to do around swamps for

like a ohio / california person is an

important thing like in my mind Susan

when I went to Florida to make these I

literally imagined myself with waders on

with like trudging in it and like dusk

or evening light and getting these kind

of you know I think that it it's cotton

yeah anyway I'm laughing at myself

after visiting the swamps I realized

that there would be no going into the

swamp with where's that they're there

alligators because there were alligators

already waiting yeah and so to go back

to your question I think that I think

that there's always something to learn

in what it means to make photographs

like what it means in in enacting and I

said something years ago that is still

true even with a landscape photograph is

that whenever you're putting yourself

out there in the world there is a moment

of bearing witness that is utterly

important and that happens also within a

landscape that owl was there for me to

look at in that moment and I think that

even though landscape might offer us

solace it also is a marker of our time

and how quickly this precious planet

that we're living on is actually

changing and it's only vulnerability and

the same thing with vulnerability around

humanity and I think those are the

things that I constantly learn that I

can embed these different things that

are so important to me to talk about

within various bodies of work um that's

really um it's so interesting I just

want to make sure I want to go through

some of these other say about these

Susan it's like that I laugh at and

people in the studio kind of don't

really understand what I'm saying but I

also think of these is almost a mature

National Geographic photographs right

they're not quite good enough to be a

National Geographic but they're doing

something else like if you spend time

with this image the last one you had

you'll notice that I'm using what is

called in photography has depth of field

in a very interesting way so I was

actually photographing with an 8 by 10

camera like I did handle most landscapes

with you would have everything in focus

in the foreground and middle ground and

background and I'm really allowing only

only the middle ground for the most part

to be in focus in these images and that

changes the way that you think about

using a camera from like what a

professional photographer would look at

so I'm kind of playing around with the

language between amateur and

professional in in people's minds about

how a photograph is constructed as well

that's so interesting um that

distinction you're making between what a

nature photographer would do in a

magazine where the primary agenda would

be to be representing nature in the most

naturalistic way which is different from

what you're doing here uh it's trying to

tell a difference

through nature and so one does have

these other views I very much look

forward to seeing them again in person

to see all of those characteristics can

we look at some more yeah absolutely

because they're all really different as

well like you've captured all of these

variable views of swamps and you know

for basically a city girl like myself uh

you know a swamp is a very monolithic

kind of image not these uh different

arrays of colors and different trees I

mean this is a staggeringly beautiful

photograph yeah and it has the layers in

it that we don't really think about when

we think about a swamp and I think

that's something really important to

talk about with you is like what I think

about in relationship to iconic in

photography and how that I always try to

flip the iconic on itself in some way

for us to get a new view or enter

something with a with a new perspective

and I that's really important for me

over the years as I recognizing how I

deal with different subjects of what its

relationship to how we think a subject

is portrayed and so this is just you

know a very read kind of landscape that

goes deeper into itself and it begins to

disappear and you know I try to load

things up more metaphorically in

relationship to how we digest and look

at images that I necessarily do with

trying to find what is already known as

the kind of iconic play of things like

when I was on the ship for example when

I did 12 miles to the horizon where I

went from Korea to the Port of Long

Beach from Busan

to the Port of Long Beach on a container

ship which was on Jen shipping the body

of work that I did was every sunrise and

every sunset because it's the most

cliche thing that you can do in

photography but in the end of the day

some days it was too foggy for the Sun

to rise and so how that breaks with how

we think of time and also the cliche

besides being iconic how do we kind of

collapse the cliche to a certain extent

and those are all things that I'm

constantly playing with and making

bodies of work um it's so interesting

because you know I see this photograph

and I think of the earliest

representations of landscape which I

think of like late 15th century

Netherlandish landscapes and they're

classically constructed just like this

you know the foreground is the darkest

color the image is the starkest there

and then as it goes from foreground to

middle to further middle to background

it gets lighter and lighter and lighter

and less distinct and you're clearly

playing on that classical tradition here

yes but I'm not I'm not that far away

from you know being a closeted old

painter looking for actually so where

you must be on a tour abode in this one

no I'm actually on a bridge oh and so

I'm on a bridge and it's pouring rain

and they've stopped the tour boats where

I was because of the pouring rain so I'm

just walking the ramps around the swamp

and this is a private adventure swamp

connected to Okefenokee but it's not the

National Park of Okefenokee it's like a

subset private kind of place and I've

always been interested in that too like

what isn't that preserved versus people

who take people out of swamp chores and

feed the alligators chicken and things

like that which isn't that great for the

ecosystem so how do we ecologic look at

tourism within nature but it's pouring

rain and it was just beautiful because

the light and everything it's pretty

hard not to take an image like this and

you know and cameras freeze things like

there's a thing called a shutter speed

and to freeze drops of water coming in

is just I don't know it's utterly poetic

for me and I I personally don't mind

going down that road as well well uh

it's absolutely right I mean the texture

of the water the ripples created by the

different drops and then the way that

the water is moving in some places and

the reflection of the Sun on it I mean

it really is lyrical what you've

captured here it's beautiful and it's

funny because that the opening people

were looking at and like asking me like

oh my god how did you make that

photograph you know you know me I mean

you you actually know me pretty well

we've we've spent time and dinner

parties together and so forth and I was

just like it was raining that's what

happens but this truly does give the

sense that you are alone in nature uh in

this you know not great weather so it's

actually it would be disappointing for

you to tell us that there was actually a

crowd of people behind you as well yeah

this one there wasn't so it was alone in

nature but I try to have everything feel

like that but I did find I had to cancel

it unfortunately but I was supposed to

go for my spring break in March and I

found an amazing boat driver in

Louisiana who was going to take me out

into the deep deep areas of the swamp by

myself for two days my head so I

realized

after kind of the Florida moment that I

do kind of want to be alone with a

person that I can actually say no stop

here for a while at me we'll just watch

the light change for about 30 40 minutes

here and just be in this spot which you

can't do on these public boats so I'm

realizing now the body work you know

isn't finished I haven't explored it to

its its capacity in my mind and I'm

really looking forward to meeting up

with Andrew to explore the Louisiana

swamps with them oh wow that would be

amazing we all look forward to seeing

those photographs here's another one but

I want to go to the final image so the

day that we visited you with the

directors Advisory Board in your studio

we were also joined by the Cantor's new

assistant curator of photography Maggie

deadlock and prior to us even making the

plan to go and visit you in your studio

when she arrived she looked at the

collection and we talked about things uh

photographs work that she might want to

add to it and she said you know it would

be really great if we could acquire a

work by Cathy u P so she came with us on

this studio visit and this is the

photograph that she has picked out and

that we are considering for acquisition

at the canter can you tell us a little

bit about it yeah I think that this is

like another interesting complicated

photograph of a swamp in which that most

people who look at it say like why is

there snow on the ground well there is

no snow on the ground it is bog water

that bubbles up and gives off this kind

of white foam on the surface and I'm

particularly interested in Black Bottom

swamps because of the prior image you

showed where how they Mir they reflect

so a black bottom swamp has in

enormous amount of mirroring reflective

quality to it because of the plants that

you know what it's doing to its

ecosystem of making the water you know

you look at the water and you think it's

just like pure mud it's not you pick it

up and it looks like a teabag have gone

in the water because of all the plant

life and so the one go back to the one

that you guys are thinking of acquiring

what I love about that is just the

layers of light in it that the if you

look deep into the photograph in the

background all of a sudden the light is

streaming through the trees in a way

that has this little highlight and it

brings this kind of red leaf of Bush out

in a certain way and it just becomes a

really complicated photograph of how we

view landscape that immediately you

think it's snow and then you have to

re-evaluate things and that's what I

want people to do with photographs is I

actually want them to spend more time

thinking about how a photograph is what

it's doing in it than necessarily a

quick read so the idea that then all

over time you realize like oh it's foam

what is that foam or you look at how

it's leveled it's sorry I looked over my

partner just came into the office but

but yeah that's that's one of the

reasons why I really really love that

image it's actually one of my favorite

images in the series ah Maggie is an

astute curator um yeah it's one of my

favorites as well and I love the the

hanging quality of the branches in the

foreground they kind of remind me of a

theater curtain opening up on to a scene

behind it and then of course one is

somewhat disturbed by the foam and why

there is a foam like that in such an

isolated place of nature is it the

degradation of the environment is it

natural do you know

it's is natural it's a natural

occurrence in which that the plant life

is releasing oxygen and it creates this

kind of I don't know exactly what the

phone was called if I was with the

naturalist he could tell sip of

anybody's naturalist and wants to chat

the actual name of it but it happens in

in where it's bog it's a bog at this

point where it's just releasing kind of

nitrogen into the water and it creates

this kind of foamy substance sorry for

my inarticulate no no interesting all

right I want to go uh this is more of

the swamps and then there are the eight

monitors yes I'm gonna be nine now Oh as

even though I thought I was done

apparently I'm not done well there has

to be a coven nineteen collage of course

not have a Cove in nineteen collage

during the Trump administration so what

magazines are you collecting images from

everything every source you know so from

Time magazine to the week to The New

Yorker to survivalist magazines to gay

rights magazines to pop farmer magazines

to agricultural magazines home beauty

country home that little dog little

sheriff dog down there on that corner of

the collage next to Mitch McConnell

wearing a Bernie Sanders t-shirt you

know little little little Sheriff dog

just was cut out from a country magazine

that you could buy you could buy this

little ceramic dog with a sheriff's

outfit and I just kept laughing at him

about him there he comes he comes in

right now and it's like he was sheriff

puppy to me and it's like it's absurd

then you have McConnell come in so all

of them in a certain way with the

animator

with an amazing animator who just had

graduated from CalArts by the name of

Sam curry who I would dictate how I

wanted because the clouds was all made

so then we had to break it apart and

rebuilding it rebuild it again in

animation here comes Zuckerberg so this

is how I would kind of narrate it to him

and in Zuckerberg is gonna get a big

wheelbarrow full of cash because you

know he's just gotten Facebook he just

needs his big wheelbarrow cash so he's

going to dip down in that wheelbarrow

and Pence is an angel but he's got his

gun but wait Zuckerberg doesn't need

cash because Zuckerberg has to hold a

big baby and so all of a sudden

Zuckerberg is a baby man you know so

there's that kind of humor that actually

you don't see in my work that's the

interesting thing is I actually I mean

personally I think that I have a good

sense of humor either my students are

laughing at me because I'm an idiot or

they actually value that I have a sense

of humor but this body of work really

brings the humor in for me in a

different way than other bodies of work

and there's they're the judges they're

like gone

tick-tock with their heads the the

wonderful Sun and here comes money man

and it's like you know this is like

probably cut out of some financial times

but then on the hundred dollar bill

you're going to end up with Elizabeth

Warren's face and you know Trump with

his guns and his boots hands up being a

drag queen Pence ends up having his

rifle taken away there's the gay flag

coming in so he's just instead of being

a quaint King he's going to become a

queen and there's the drag I the boots

get kicked off and a pair of heels come

on and passes gun gets replaced with

weed and Elizabeth Warren gets to be on

the hundred dollar bill if only and tell

us about uh putting it all on a grid

like that you know the grid in uh my

turn ism has come to be read as the

equalizing feature everything is the

same why do you choose a grid here

you're trying to topple hierarchy yeah I

wanted to disrupt the grid and that's

why the hand to painted it is I wanted

to topple hierarchy in that way that

that you know the tiny little boxes the

what they represent in terms of being

able to make perfect equations well what

is the perfection around equations if we

don't actually have humanity within that

equation yeah they're so interesting so

interesting I look forward to seeing the

kovat 19 monitor you get all of those

magazines delivered to your house I

actually Julie felt there were too many

mega seeds delivered I also cut out free

over a two year period of time every

photograph in the LA Times but one of

those ended up in this so the

interesting thing that you don't really

ever see in making a body of work is the

research and artists does it to get to

that place and so there's there's like

you know stacks and stacks of folder of

every day with that day written down of

it of LA Times photographs but I ended

up not wanting to use peer kind of

journalism as as the image I wanted to

borrow more and I like the glossy

material better from magazines the way

that they read in the collage versus the

newsprint yeah and the juxtaposition of

you know good old-fashioned print media

and the full scale iPhone is really a

great one each pushing up against the

other the new technology the old

technology it really makes for a

visually compelling object

you should see me I was so excited when

I ordered the monitor on Amazon thank

you Jeff anyway I first looked at

Alibaba and I was trying to figure out

how to make a custom monitor and then

when these came up and this specific

maker of the monitor I was and how it

looked like the early iPhone with the

curves you know and and it has these

stainless steel finish around the edge

just like the first iteration of the

iPhone ad and we got into the studio and

we put the first done collage on it I

was just like oh my gosh I'm so excited

this is it we found our form yeah it's

really amazing hey Cathy we are coming

to the end of our time would you mind

taking a question or two I would love to

take a questioner today I'm gonna stop

sharing my screen and see and if anyone

wants to submit a question on the chat

um um let me they you are welcome to so

uh if anyone can wants to submit a

question well Norman Roth did ask any

which I kind of answered a little bit in

your question any political significance

to the idea that swamps are a

consequence of the decay of nature and I

think that yeah there there is a

significance to that because you know I

try not to ever drink out of a plastic

water bottle and I use you know we don't

buy ziplock bags so we we compost we

garden we try to be as kind as we can I

Drive an electric car so there is a

consequence to the decay of environment

that I definitely find in swamps but

also therefore Jill

it's incredibly fragile ecosystem that

will disappear and of what I know of you

you do live your politics here I have a

question for you someone asks can you

talk about the relationship between skin

and swamps and of course that's someone

who knows your pre artwork you know

there that's an interesting question

because I think that there's there's

different aspects to everything but I

really do look at it as one big large

kind of organism that both skin and

swamps are organism we absorb everything

from our environments on the skin in the

same way that trees talk to each other

you guys want a really great book to

read read the overstory that'll have you

make you think about trees in a way that

you've never thought about trees before

or maybe you have but I do think about

how it is all connected and the that's

part of getting to humanity as well as

the relationship to connectivity we have

to this precious earth that we live on

yeah yeah all right Kathy this has been

so interesting I'm so grateful that you

are part of this conversation and I very

much look forward to seeing more of your

work and continuing to talk to you about

Miss series thank you thank you so much

for everything that you do and the

remarkable exhibitions that you bring

forth to the community and thank you

also for including my work in your

collection

I really really appreciate that oh we

are working on it we can't wait to be

back in the building and have our

systems in place again so yeah we're

really looking forward to it and for

everybody who signed on thank you so

much be safe be healthy embrace the ones

you love and yeah I appreciate you

spending some time with Susan and mine

yep

I concur thank you everyone we'll see

you all again soon
