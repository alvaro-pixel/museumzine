    <!-- Page is mainly about the reasons behind making the site and selecting museums as subject matter
        as a summary, the reason for the about page is because I work with a musing consulting company,
        ever since the pandemic started museums across the globe have suffered, in poorer areas the damage
        has been worse, I think the site as a  project reflecting and looking for resources to teach others
        about museums and art in general, shape their lives and hopefully get them visit museums more often.

                    Greetings, my name is Alvaro,
                I’m a student at the University of London’s CS online program
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I made this project for the web development course, I work for a company called museum planning llc so I’m passionate about the museum world and the events that have been taking place since the pandemic. 

                    Most of us regard museums at spaces where creativity, openess and learning takes place and it is no surprise the events taking place around the world have deeply affected museum visitorship. This project is both a chance to showcase the learned skills in the web development module and way to to help raise more awarness about museums and their role in our lives.
